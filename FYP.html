				<h1>SELF ORGANIZING TASK REPRESENTATION FOR CONTINUAL LEARNING</h1>
				<!-- <span class="image lef\"><img src="images/FYP_architecture.png" alt="" /></span> -->
				<p>Humans and animals can continually acquire, fine-tune, and transfer knowledge and
					skills throughout their lifespan. This ability, referred to as lifelong learning, is mediated by a
					rich set of neurocognitive mechanisms that together contribute to the development and specialization
					of our sensorimotor skills as well as to long-term memory
					consolidation and retrieval. Consequently, lifelong learning capabilities are crucial
					for computational systems and autonomous agents interacting in the real world and
					processing continuous streams of information.</p>
				<p>Machine learning approaches generally learn from a stream of data randomly sampled
					from a stationery data distribution. Continual learning is a paradigm where the data
					distribution and learning objective change through time. A Continual learning system can be defined
					as an adaptive algorithm capable
					of learning from a continuous stream of information, with such information becoming progressively
					available over time and where the number of tasks to be learned
					(e.g. membership classes in a classification task) are not predefined. Continual learning intend to
					mitigate a phenomenon called <span style="font-weight:bold">Catastrophic forgetting</span>. To
					understand this consider a situation where a neural network pre-trained on some data needs to be
					trained again with some newly encountered data. If the previously
					trained model is re-trained with the newly encountered data, the previously learned
					knowledge will be overwritten, which is called catastrophic forgetting. With the traditional
					(offline) deep learning algorithms, overcoming this will consume more time and
					computational power. Hence, in the CL scenario, a learning model is required to incrementally build
					and dynamically update internal representations as the distribution of tasks dynamically
					changes across its lifetime.</p>

					Our research involved in making use of the existing methodlogies to create a hybrid approch, which
					emphasises a streight forward take away in the continual learning research field. We took image
					classifictaion problem for this work. Continual learning methodologies address some key concepts to
					build the work on. The important ones are classes and tasks. A class carry the traditional meaning
					in a classification problem. A task can be defined as a set of classes which are given at once.
					Thus, a continal learning problem will have several tasks given incrementally. We used CoRE50
					dataset for experiments, which is specifically designed to benchmark continual learning approaches.
					The method we came
					with was able to outperform some major works done previously, but not the state of the art as of
					2020(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02509">REMIND</a>).

					In this project I worked Architectural methods and rehearsal methods. Deciding on which methods to
					choose and incooporate was the first task. I worked with GWR(Grow When Required) and its adaptation.
					On the other hand in rehersal, I worked with Latent Replay rehersal method. There were many test
					cases to include methods from continual learning and other CNN approaches. The finalized
					architecture is as follows.
